<p>Solidity is "an object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts...programs which govern the behaviour of accounts within the Ethereum state‚Äù (<a href="https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/" target="_blank">source</a>). While a few smart contract programming languages have developed over the years, Solidity remains the most dominant one.</p>
<p>As we mentioned earlier, Solidity is a higher-order language meaning that the code deployed with a smart contract is not Solidity, but rather EVM bytecode. Solidity is an abstraction on top of that fundamental language so we don't have to be writing code that looks like this: </p>

</code></pre></div>

<p>But, rather code that looks like this: </p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>  pragma solidity &gt;=0.4.0 &lt;0.9.0;  

  contract MyContract {      
    uint i = 10 + 2 * 2;  
  }    
</code></pre></div>

<p>While both these blocks of code describe the same operation, the second version (Solidity) is much easier to read and write. </p>
<h2 id="general-characteristics-of-solidity">General Characteristics of Solidity</h2>
<p>Solidity uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript" target="_blank">ECMAScript</a> syntax like JavaScript, to make it approachable for web developers. However, do not be lulled into complacency! Solidity is much more demanding in its requirements.</p>
<p>Some of Solidity's basic characteristics: 
* <strong>Case Sensitive</strong>
* <strong>Statement termination via a semicolon <code>;</code></strong>
* <strong>Files use the <code>.sol</code> extension</strong>
* <strong>Statically typed</strong> Types need to be known at compile time. This makes Solidity more like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript" target="_blank">TypeScript</a> than JavaScript in practice.
* <strong>Various compilation options</strong> Solidity compiling can be done on the command line by <a href="https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/installing-solidity.html" target="_blank">Solc</a>, you can compile it in a web-browser using <a href="http://remix.ethereum.org/" target="_blank">Remix,</a> or compile it as part of a smart contract development framework like <a href="https://www.trufflesuite.com/" target="_blank">Truffle</a> or <a href="https://www.hardhat.org" target="_blank">Hardhat</a>.
* <strong>Compiles down to EVM bytecode</strong> Which then runs within the Ethereum Virtual Machine when deployed to a network</p>
<p>Overall, the Solidity workflow can be illustrated as follows: <img alt="graphic showing workflow of solidity to EVM" src="../../../img/S03/solidity-workflow.png" /></p>
<p>In this section, we're going to go over the basic conventions of Solidity. We're also going to start building smart contracts and discussing their general structure and design patterns.</p>
<p>We can't emphasize this enough: smart contract coding is both really exciting and really dangerous! We see smart contracts <code>[rekt](https://rekt.news/){target=_blank}</code> every day! We want to both give you all the tools to both build with creativity <em>and</em> confidence. Let's go!</p>
